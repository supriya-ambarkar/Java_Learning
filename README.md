Learning the Language Java 

Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems(now owned by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995. 
It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed,
regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
